Conduct a full repository dead-code sweep across frontend, backend, and tooling directories. For every suspect item, provide at least six validation steps, including dependency-graph inspection and cross-file reference checks. Report certainty level, cleanup-vs-implement rating (1â€“100), estimated line removals, and create both removal and revival task stubs with exact file and symbol references.
