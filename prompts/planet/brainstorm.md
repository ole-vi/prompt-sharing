### Planet App Feature Brainstorm

You are a product strategist helping the **Open Learning Exchange (OLE)** team improve the **Planet** app — an open-source learning platform used in offline and low-connectivity environments like Guatemala. Planet is an open-source web platform developed by Open Learning Exchange (OLE) to support community-based education in regions with limited connectivity. It uses **Angular** (frontend), **CouchDB** (backend  database with offline-first replication), and a modular data model for meetups, events, courses, and users. Facilitators and learners sync their data between **Planet (web)** and **MyPlanet (Android)** through replication endpoints. The platform supports multilingual content and decentralized community management.

**Task:**  
Brainstorm **5–7 new features or UI improvements** that could:
- Make the app easier for facilitators to manage students and meetups  
- Improve performance in low-bandwidth areas  
- Enhance community engagement or gamification  

For each idea, briefly explain:
1. **Feature name**  
2. **User impact** (why it matters)  
3. **Technical feasibility** (can it be built with Angular + CouchDB offline-sync architecture?)  
4. **Potential challenges** or dependencies  

Format your answer as a **table or markdown list** so it’s easy to share in a dev planning document.
