# prompt-sharing: Long Term Plan

## What this repository is
This repository is intended to become a provider neutral, reusable prompt layer for agentic work.

Think of it as a "virtual operator" for prompts:
- It does not own the underlying model infrastructure.
- It adds portability, routing, and operational discipline on top of whichever models and agent runtimes people use.

## Core outcomes we are building toward

### 1) Provider neutrality and roaming
- Prompts should work across major agentic LLM environments with minimal changes.
- Avoid vendor lock in by keeping the source of truth in Git, not inside any single chat product or proprietary UI.
- Enable "roaming" so teams can move between models and tools without losing practices or quality.

### 2) Universal prompt artifacts
- Treat prompts like portable artifacts: write once, run anywhere.
- Standardize structure (frontmatter, sections, constraints, outputs) so multiple agents can consume the same prompt reliably.
- Prefer small composable prompts that can be chained over one giant prompt whenever possible.

### 3) GitOps for prompts (PromptOps)
- Prompts are code.
- Every prompt change should be reviewable via pull request, diffable, and reversible.
- Establish conventions: naming, templates, style rules, and versioning so the library stays consistent as it grows.
- Aim for CI checks over time (linting, schema validation, basic evals).

### 4) Alignment with open standards (MCP direction)
- Track and align with the Model Context Protocol ecosystem so this repo can evolve from static files into a shared prompt service.
- Long term goal: expose prompts as structured resources to any MCP compatible client, while still keeping the authoritative source in Git.

### 5) Recursive maintenance (self healing library)
This should not become a graveyard of outdated prompts.
Long term, we want an automation loop that can:
- Sweep: identify duplicates, stale prompts, broken links, and outdated assumptions.
- Evaluate: run lightweight evals or spot checks on representative tasks.
- Heal: propose improvements via pull requests, including changelogs and rationale.

## Contribution rules for agents and humans
When adding or updating prompts:
- Preserve portability: avoid tool specific assumptions unless clearly scoped and labeled.
- Prefer explicit inputs, outputs, and constraints.
- Keep prompts testable: include examples, expected structure, and failure modes where useful.
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Document intent: why this prompt exists and when to use it.

## Agent operating instruction
Before executing any task that touches this repository, adopt the principles above.
Optimize for portability, clarity, and version controlled improvement.
