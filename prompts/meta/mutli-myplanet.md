gh repo clone ole-vi/prompt-sharing
go into that prompt-sharing directory and switch to dogi branch
there you read all prompt markdown in prompts/myplanet directory
you now should have multiple daily and weekly prompts for the myplanet repo
anyhow in the context of those prompts do a deep dive into the myplanet repo
and do full analysis it
aving done that grade the prompts by how good you think they are and explain
suggest for each at least one maximum 5 improve prompts
which you present in an easy copy-able way
and tell me what you changed and and why
at last suggest at least 5 missing prompts (blindspots)
also present them in an easy copy-able way
and explain what you suggest and and why
