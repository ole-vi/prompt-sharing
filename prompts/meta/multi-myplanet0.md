gh repo clone ole-vi/prompt-sharing
go into that prompt-sharing directory and switch to dogi branch
there you read all prompt markdown in prompts/myplanet directory
you now should have multiple daily and weekly prompts for the myplanet repo
anyhow keeping in mind those prompts do a deep dive into the myplanet repo 
and do full analysis it specially under the context which prompts are necessary 

having done that grade the prompts (1 to 100) by how good you think they are and explain 
suggest for each at least 3 by text structure or formatting improved prompts 
which you present in an easy copy-able way
and tell me what you changed and and why
at last suggest based on the blindspots of above prompt
prompt I should know about - I prefer general useable over specific one
also present them in an easy copy-able way
and explain what you suggest and and why
