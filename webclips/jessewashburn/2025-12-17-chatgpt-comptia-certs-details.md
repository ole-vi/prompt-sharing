ChatGPT8:35 PMHere’s a breakdown of each cert, what it covers, who it’s for, and key exam details.

---

## 1. CompTIA A+ Core 1

**Current exam:** 220-1201 (A+ V15, launched March 25, 2025) [CompTIA+2CompTIA+2](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/a/core-1-v15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What it is**

Core 1 is the first half of the A+ certification. It’s very much “PC + basic network plumbing + cloud basics” for entry-level IT support / help desk.

**Focus areas (domains)** [Get Certified+1](https://getcertified.ecpi.edu/a-1201-core-1/a-1201-core-1-objectives/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Mobile devices (13%)** – laptops, phones, tablets, ports, accessories, common issues.
- **Networking (23%)** – SOHO networks, TCP/IP basics, cables/connectors, Wi-Fi standards, small switches/routers.
- **Hardware (25%)** – motherboards, CPUs, RAM, storage, power supplies, printers, peripheral devices.
- **Virtualization & cloud (11%)** – client-side virtualization, basic cloud models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) and use cases.
- **Hardware & network troubleshooting (28%)** – structured troubleshooting process and common hardware/network problems.

**Exam details** [CompTIA+2StationX+2](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/a/core-1-v15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Code: **220-1201**

## 4. CompTIA Security+

**Current exam:** SY0-701 (Security+ V7, launched Nov 7, 2023) [CompTIA+3CompTIA+3Contentful+3](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/security/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What it is**

Baseline, vendor-neutral **cybersecurity** cert. It’s a common requirement for US government / DoD roles and a lot of entry-to-mid-level security positions. Focus is broad: risk, architecture, operations, and incident response rather than deep specialization.

**Focus areas (simplified)** [Contentful+2Destination Certification+2](https://assets.ctfassets.net/82ripq7fjls2/6TYWUym0Nudqa8nGEnegjG/0f9b974d3b1837fe85ab8e6553f4d623/CompTIA-Security-Plus-SY0-701-Exam-Objectives.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The SY0-701 version tightens the content around:

- **Threats, vulnerabilities & attacks** – malware, social engineering, network attacks, cloud threats, indicators of compromise.
- **Security architecture & design** – secure network and system design, zero trust principles, segmentation, secure configurations.
- **Governance, risk & compliance** – policies, standards, frameworks, risk management, privacy and legal basics.
- **Identity and access management** – authN/authZ, MFA, SSO, federation, account security.
- **Security operations & incident response** – monitoring, SIEM basics, playbooks, containment, eradication, recovery.

**Exam details** [CompTIA+4CompTIA+4Contentful+4](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/security/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Code: **SY0-701**
- Questions: up to **90** (MCQ + performance-based)
- Time: **90 minutes**
- Passing score: **750 / 900**
- Recommended experience: **Network+ + ~2 years** in security/sysadmin
- Validity: **3 years**, renewable

**Typical roles**

- Security Analyst (entry-level)
- Security Administrator / Junior SecOps
- Systems / Network Admin with security responsibilities

Security+ is often treated as the **baseline security cert** in hiring pipelines and as a stepping stone to CySA+, PenTest+, and higher-level certs. [CompTIA+1](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/blog/the-comptia-cybersecurity-career-pathway-employable-skills-found-here/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 5. CompTIA CySA+ (Cybersecurity Analyst+)

**Current exam:** CS0-003 [Infosec Institute+2TSTC - ICT & Security Training+2](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/cysa/comptia-csa-certification-overview-career-path/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What it is**

Intermediate **blue-team / SOC analyst** cert. It’s more operational than Security+: less “what is a firewall?” and more **“how do I use SIEM, detections, and vuln scans to actually defend an environment?”**

**Focus areas (4 domains)** [Infosec Institute+2prepsaret.com+2](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/cysa/the-cysa-plus-knowledge-domains/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 6. How these five fit together (rough path)

CompTIA itself roughly positions them in this order: [CompTIA+2Wikipedia+2](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/blog/the-comptia-cybersecurity-career-pathway-employable-skills-found-here/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

1. **A+ Core 1 & Core 2** – entry-level IT support / generalist baseline.
2. **Network+** – builds solid networking fundamentals.
3. **Security+** – baseline security knowledge on top of A+ / Network+.
4. **CySA+** – deeper, hands-on defensive security and SOC work.

Given your background (you’re already a seasoned infra/Net/Sec person), these certs are mostly useful as **signals for juniors** you’re mentoring or hiring, and as boxes to tick for DoD / government compliance. Content-wise:

- A+ would be trivial for you.
- Network+ / Security+ will be easy if you live in networks & security daily.
- CySA+ is the one that actually leans into day-to-day defender workflows (SIEM, vuln mgmt, IR).

If you want, next step I can:

- Map **specific job roles** (e.g. help desk, NOC, SOC) to a minimal cert stack, or
- Suggest **study order and what to skip** for someone who already has strong real-world experience.
